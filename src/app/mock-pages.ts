She remembered that first, jolting <i>My mother drank alone</i>; its attendant kindness. She remembered Rocco’s “pay attention.” (And she has.) She remembered to breathe. So when her mother, silver-chimed drink in hand, returned to the sunporch and stood and looked out into the back yard, when she said, &quot;So you still blame me?&quot; Jewell hears an opening.</p><p><em>Still?</em></p><p>&quot;I know you didn&#39;t know. I know that, she began, letting the darkness soften her voice. How could you? In those days? Nobody knew about men like Mr. Allen.</p><p>Well, some people did. But not her mother.</p><p>Her mother walked to the chaise lounge, slammed her drink on the glass-topped table, sat down to light a cigarette. “That monster!”</p><p>“We can both agree to that.”</p><p>“You asked me if I still blame you. And the answer is—it depends.</p><p>The grown Jewell doesn’t. On a good day. When I’m—functional. But sometimes I’m not. Sometimes I’m still a little girl in a fussy dress. She&#39;s the one who ran away.&quot; And she’s the one, lipsticked and primped, you left alone with a predator. A child molester. An evil human being.</p><p>&quot;So you—&quot;</p><p>“She wanted her mommy to protect her from the monster in the basement.”</p><p>Her mother gasped, strode to the sunporch screen, hugged herself.</p><p>Ashamed of what she has let loose, ashamed of what she hasn’t, Jewell appeased—she was so damned good at that: “When you took in Mr. Allen? You did it because Nana’s friends sang his praises. And because you had to. I get that. Believe me, over the years, when I was broke? I made choices I’m not proud of. I know what it means to do something because you’re desperate. And you had me to support. I get that.”</p><p>She sensed pricked ears: Like what? What choices? But kept going: &quot;So I left—mostly, I guess, because I thought I had to get away from all of it. And over the years it’s just been easier—”</p><p>She stopped herself. “You know what a friend told me when I told her</p><p>I was coming here? After all these years? ‘Mothers get better.’ And you have. You really have, Mama. I appreciate so much about—”</p><p>&quot;Why did you come? Now?&quot;</p><p>Her mother is no fool.</p><p>&quot;Lots of reasons. I knew it was about time. I wanted to meet Wheeler—&quot; Jewell paused. “And I needed to hear about Nana. From you. Person to person. And that&#39;s about it,&quot; she lied.</p><p>They were silent for a while.</p><p>“You said I was a stranger, “ Jewell continued. “How else could I be? But I’ve been wanting—you need to hear this one thing.”</p><p>Jewell felt her mother tense: Good God, what now?</p><p>“I’m sorry I put you through that.”</p><p>“You say that so fast, so rushed, like you don’t—”</p><p>&quot;Seems like there’s plenty we both could be saying to each other. Over time. We don’t have to say it all tonight.”</p>"
